4. Running Experiments
Vary Threads: Test with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads.

Vary Partitions: Use b = 4 (16 partitions) to b = 16 (65K partitions).

Measure:

bash
Copy
perf stat -e cache-misses,dTLB-load-misses ./your_program
5. Key Analysis Points
Contention: Compare throughput of Concurrent Output at low vs. high partitions.

Fragmentation: Independent Output requires merging partitions post-processing.

Cache Behavior: Use perf to correlate cache misses with performance drops.

6. Core Affinity
Set thread affinity to reduce cache contention:

cpp
Copy
#include <sched.h>
void set_affinity(std::thread& t, int core_id) {
    cpu_set_t cpuset;
    CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
    CPU_SET(core_id, &cpuset);
    pthread_setaffinity_np(t.native_handle(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset);
}
7. Expected Results
Concurrent Output: Faster at low partitions (contiguous writes), slower at high partitions (contention).

Independent Output: Scales better with threads but requires post-merging.

Next Steps
Implement data generation.

Integrate timing/measurement code.

Run experiments with varying parameters.

Use perf to collect hardware metrics.

Compare results with the paperâ€™s findings.
